## Contribution Guide
Want to contribute a new syllabus or update an existing one? Perfect! Just make your changes in the `_posts` directory and submit a pull request. We will review all submissions and approve those that meet the criteria below. 

To add a new syllabus, copy this template to a new file in the `_posts` directory named `<your_syllabus_slug>.md`. Slugs should be unique and succint.

### Front Matter
All syllabi require the following frontmatter to render proberly on the page. 

`title`: The title of your area of study, with the first character a related emoji. 

`author`: Your `name` (or the name of your company), a short `bio` that will display exactly as is after your name, and one `link` that will open if a user clicks on your name in the syllabus page (can be any social media or website).

`tags`: the tags that appropriately describe your area of study. Feel free to add new tags, but use existing tags if they are relevant. 

Existing tags include: `life`, `tech`, `cooking`, `environment`, `arts`

### Content Structure
The syllabi are designed to be a loose list of online resources, sample assignments, books, blog posts, films and documentaries, etc that a student could use to self-study a topic (think of it as if you were sending a resource list to your friend). They should be succinct enough to prevent learning overwhelm, but exhaustive enough to actually help the student gain a foundational understanding of the topic. 

Each topic will probably warrant its own structure, so feel free to define your own. In general, the curriculum should be segmented into sections that should be completed from top to bottom. Each section can contain a variety of different resources, categorized with an emoji:

- `📖 Book`
- `📽️ Movie/Documentary`
- `📺 Online Video or Playlist`
- `📝 Blog Post`
- `🔗 Online Resource`
- `✍️ Assignment`
- `😄 Person to Follow`
- `🎙️ Podcast`
