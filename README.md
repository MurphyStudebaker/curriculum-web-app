### Front Matter
All syllabi require the following frontmatter to render proberly on the page. 

`title`: The title of your area of study, with the first character a related emoji. 

`author`: Your `name` (or the name of your company), a short `bio` that will display exactly as is after your name, and up to 3 social media `links` that will display under your bio on the syllabus page.    

`tags`: the tags that appropriately describe your area of study. Feel free to add new tags, but use existing tags if they are relevant. 

Existing tags include: `life`, `tech`, `cooking`, `environment`, `arts`

### Content Structure
The syllabi are designed to be a loose list of resources and useful content to learn the subject matter within a single year, ideally while travelling full time. Provide links to the resources you are listing wherever possible.

You are welcome to suggest new content categories, but we currently work with the following 5:

- **Required Reading**: A list of books, blog posts, or articles to read on the subject.
- **Supporting Media**: Any YouTube videos, documentaries, or other forms of media relevant to the subject matter. 
- **Field Trips**: Real world activities that can be completed to learn more on the subject matter, ideally from multiple different countries/continents. 
- **Assignments**: Any specific assignments or journal prompts that can be completed to gain mastery on the subject.
- **Volunteerships**: Any volunteer programs related to the subject matter where someone could get hands on experience while contributing to social good. 

Please try to include all 5 in your syllabus, unless there is a reason one (or multiple) sections are not suitable for your particular area of study.
